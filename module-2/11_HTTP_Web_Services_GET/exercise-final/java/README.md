# Web Services GET exercise (Java)

In this exercise, you'll work on a command-line application that displays online auction info. A portion of the command-line application is provided. You'll write the remaining functionality.

You'll add web API calls using RestTemplate to retrieve a list of auctions, details for a single auction, and filter the list of auctions by title and current bid.

These are the endpoints you'll work on for this exercise:

- GET: http://localhost:3000/auctions
- GET: http://localhost:3000/auctions/{id}
- GET: http://localhost:3000/auctions?title_like=<*value*>
- GET: http://localhost:3000/auctions?currentBid_lte=<*value*>

## Step One: Start the server

Before starting, make sure the web API is up and running. Open the command line and navigate to the `./server/` folder in this exercise.

First, run the command `npm install` to install any dependencies. You won't need to do this on any subsequent run.

To start the server, run the command `npm start`. If there aren't any errors, you'll see the following, which means that you've successfully set up your web API:

```
  \{^_^}/ hi!

  Done

  Resources
  http://localhost:3000/auctions

  Home
  http://localhost:3000

  Type s + enter at any time to create a snapshot of the database

```

## Step Two: Explore the API

Before moving on to the next step, explore the web API using Postman. You can access the following endpoints:

- GET: http://localhost:3000/auctions
- GET: http://localhost:3000/auctions/{id} (use a number between 1 and 7 in place of `{id}`)

## Step Three: Review the starting code

### Data model

There's a class provided in `/src/main/java/com/techelevator/auction/Auction.java` that represents the data model for an auction object. If you've looked at the JSON results from the API, the properties for the class should look familiar.

### Provided code

In `App.java`, you'll find three methods that print information to the console:

- `printGreeting()`: Prints menu options and routes to methods for each option
- `printAuctions()`: Prints a list of auctions
- `printAuction()`: Prints a single auction

Each of these methods is called in response to the menu selection within the `while` loop. The `if` statements determine which method to call based upon the menu selection. Notice that each of the four methods that you'll implement are called there as well.

### Your code

There are four other methods where you'll add code to call the API methods:

- `listAllAuctions()`
- `listDetailsForAuction()`
- `findAuctionsSearchTitle()`
- `findAuctionsSearchPrice()`

In the `run()` method, find the `while` loop. Notice how each menu option is evaluated and these methods are called. The `while` loop returns users back to the menu.

## Step Four: Write the console application

There are three variables declared for you at the top of the class that you can use throughout your exercise:

```java
public class App {

    public static final String API_URL = "http://localhost:3000/auctions";
    public static RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
    private static Scanner scanner;

    // ...

}
```

### List all auctions

In the `listAllAuctions()` method, find the comment `//api code here`. Add code here to:

- Use the RestTemplate to request all auctions and save them into an array of Auctions
- Replace the current return statement to return the array of auctions

Once you've done this, run the unit tests. After the tests `listAllAuctions()` and `listAllAuctionsNoAuctions()` pass, you can run the application. If you select option 1 on the menu, you'll see the ID, title, and current bid for each auction.

### List details for a specific auction

In the `listDetailsForAuction()` method, find the `//api code here` comment. Add code here to:

- Use RestTemplate to request a specific auction by ID
- Return the single auction

Once you've done this, run the unit tests. After the test `listDetailsForAuction()` passes, you can run the application. If you select option 2 on the menu, and enter an ID of one of the auctions, you'll see the full details for that auction.

### Find auctions with a specified term in the title

In the `getByTitle(String title)` method, find the `//api code here` comment. Add code here to:

- Use RestTemplate to request all auctions which match the `title` parameter and save them into an array of Auctions.
- The API URL requires a query string with the key named `title_like` and the value of the `title` parameter. This requests the server to search for auctions that have a title containing the value in the `title` parameter.
- Replace the current return statement to return the array of auctions. Return null if no auctions were found.

Once you've done this, run the unit tests. After the tests `findAuctionsSearchTitle()` and `findAuctionsSearchTitleNotFound()` pass, run the application. If you select option 3 on the menu, and enter a string, like `watch`, you'll see the ID, title, and current bid for each auction that matches.

### Find auctions below a specified price

The final method, `getByPrice(double price)`, also uses a query string. The parameter key is `currentBid_lte` and has the value of the `price` parameter. This requests the server to search for auctions that have a `currentBid` that's **L**ess **T**han or **E**qual to the value you supply.

Find the `//api code here` comment and add code here to:

- Use RestTemplate to request all auctions which are less than or equal to the `price` parameter and save them into an array of Auctions.
- The API URL requires a query string with the key named `currentBid_lte` and the value of the `price` parameter. This requests the server to search for auctions that have a price less than or equal to the value in the `title` parameter.
- Replace the current return statement to return the array of auctions. Return null if no auctions were found.

Once you've done this, run the unit tests. After the tests `findAuctionsSearchPrice()` and `findAuctionsSearchPriceNotFound()` pass, run the application. If you select option 4 on the menu and enter a number, like `150`, you'll see the ID, title, and current bid for each auction that matches.

Since the value is a `double`, you can enter a decimal value, too. Try entering `125.25`, and then `125.20`, and observe the differences between the two result sets. The "Mad-dog Sneakers" don't appear in the second list because the current bid for them is `125.23`.
