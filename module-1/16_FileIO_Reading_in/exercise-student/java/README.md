# File I/O (Reading)

The purpose of this exercise is to provide you with the opportunity to create command-line applications that can read and analyze files.

## Learning objectives

After completing this exercise, you'll understand:

* How to read data from a text file.
* How to create complex, interactive command-line applications that are data-driven.
* How to handle file paths provided as application input.
* How to read, interpret, and resolve errors related to file I/O.

## Evaluation criteria and functional requirements

Your code will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

* The project must not have any build errors.
* The expected results are returned from the application.
* The unit tests pass as expected.
  * Note: Tests are provided for the WordSearch exercise only.
* Paths to the input files aren't hard codedâ€”that is, the user must be able to enter the path to the input file.
* Your code must be able to handle exceptions for I/O issues, like a missing or unreadable input file.

### Part One: WordSearch program

In this exercise, you'll write a program that searches the contents of a file for a word. For each occurrence of the word in the file, you'll display the line number and the contents of that line in the console.

The tests for this exercise are in the file `src/test/java/com/techelevator/WordSearchTests.java`. If you run these tests before working on the exercise, all tests fail. As you complete each step, more tests pass.

**NOTE**: Line numbers begin with 1.

#### Step One: Collect user input and perform search

When the program runs, it must first prompt the user for a filesystem path and a word to search for in the file.

The curriculum team provided a test file called `alices_adventures_in_wonderland.txt` to use as test input. After collecting the required information from the user, you can search through the file for all occurrences of the search word and output that to the console.

While reading the file, be sure to handle any I/O exceptions that may occur. Display a message to inform the user about the error. *Remember that it's never a good idea to display the raw exception message to the user.*

Here's an example of what your application could look like:

```
What is the fully qualified name of the file that should be searched?
[path-to-the-file]
What is the search word you are looking for?
dog

1732) "Well, then," the Cat went on, "you see a dog growls when it's angry,

```

When you complete this part, the `caseInsensitiveSearch_LineNumbers` and `caseInsensitiveSearch_LineText` tests now pass.
#### Step Two: Modify program for case-sensitive word search

Modify the WordSearch program to ask the user if the search should be case sensitive.

Here's an example:

```
What is the fully qualified name of the file that should be searched?
[path-to-the-file]
What is the search word you are looking for?
Who
Should the search be case sensitive? (Y\N)
Y

```

When you complete this part, the `caseSensitiveSearch_LineNumbers` and `caseSensitiveSearch_LineText` tests pass.

### Part Two: QuizMaker program (Challenge)

Create a quiz maker program that asks the user a question. The user must be presented with multiple-choice answers and be allowed to specify the correct answer.

The program must read the questions from an input file during startup. The questions and answers in the file are pipe-delimited ("|"), and correct answers are marked with an asterisk ("*") in the file.

For example:
```
Question-1|answer-1|answer-2|correct-answer*|answer-4
```

An example of the file might look something like this:
```
What color is the sky?|Yellow|Blue*|Green|Red
What are Cleveland's odds of winning a championship?|Not likely*|Highly likely|Fat chance|Who cares??
```

**Tips**
* Create a class that can hold a quiz question, its available answers, and the correct answer.
* Try holding each quiz question in a list of quiz questions.

#### Step One: Ask user for input file and display first question

Ask the user a single question when the application starts. Don't show the asterisk in the list of choices.

Example
```
Enter the fully qualified name of the file to read in for quiz questions
[path-to-quiz-file]
What color is the sky?
1. Yellow
2. Blue
3. Green
4. Red

Your answer: 2
RIGHT!
```

#### Step Two: Ask user remaining questions and record correct answers

Go through all of the available quiz questions and ask the user each one sequentially. Record how many answers they got correct and print out the total at the end.

Example
```
What color is the sky?
1. Yellow
2. Blue
3. Green
4. Red

Your answer: 1
WRONG!

What are the Cleveland Browns' odds of winning a championship?
1. Not likely
2. Highly likely
3. Fat chance
4. Who cares??

Your answer: 1
RIGHT!

You got 1 answer(s) correct out of the 2 questions asked.
```

## Getting started

1. Import the `file-io-part1-exercises` project in IntelliJ.
2. Open the java file for the application you're working on. The files are located in the `src/main/java/com/techelevator` package.
3. Provide enough code to get the program started.
4. Verify your work on the command line.
5. Repeat until you've implemented all required features and all unit tests pass.

## Tips and tricks

### Practice creating command-line applications

Command-line applications can be a valuable asset to the teams that you work on. You may need to complete routine tasks with files at some scheduled intervals.

Learning how to create applications that can load data into systems, provide alerts when data is incorrect, or even automate other systems is an essential skill for developers to gain.

What tasks can you automate in your own life by applying the knowledge you now have about reading data from files?

### Get the file path from the user

Why might it be important to allow people to pass their own file path to the applications you write? How else might you get the path without explicitly asking your customer to provide the path?

### Learn how to read error messages

Learning how to read errors that occur when your applications fail is an important skill to develop as an application developer. When an error occurs, reading the error details is a great way to start the discovery process for diagnosing the problems that occurred.

### Read the documentation on File I/O

For more information on File I/O in Java, check out the [Java File Class API Docs](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/io/File.html).

You can also refer back to the [student book material on file input and output](https://book.techelevator.com/v2_4/content/file-io-ool.html).
