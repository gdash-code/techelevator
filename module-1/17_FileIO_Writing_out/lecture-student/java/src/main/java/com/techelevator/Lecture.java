		 * The java.io.File class is a representation of file and directory path names.  It provides methods to inspect and

		 * One benefit is that it compensates for differences in Windows and Unix use of '/' and '\' as directory delimiters.
		 *
		 * A new instance of File can be created from a String that contains a file system path
